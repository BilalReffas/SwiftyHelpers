# QRCodeCaptureViewController

### Description

`QRCodeCaptureViewController` is a subclass of `UIViewController` that allows you to capture and decode QRCodes.

### Usage

To use `QRCodeCaptureViewController` you have to make your `ViewController-Class` a subclass of `QRCodeCaptureViewController`. That's all. ðŸ˜‰ When your ViewController get's loaded the camera input of your device is streamed to the screen and you're ready to decode the QRCode.

``` swift
class ViewController: QRCodeCaptureViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad(animated)

        delegate = self
    }
}
```

### QRCodeCaptureDelegate

The QRCodeCaptureDelegate requires you to embed one function inside of the ViewController it is set to. The function is called `didDecodeQRCode()` and takes two parameters.

1. `withString: String` ðŸ‘‰ *the decoded String*
2. `byViewController: QRCodeCaptureViewController` ðŸ‘‰ *a reference to the ViewController used to decode the QRCode*

Passing in the ViewController allows you to decode a QRCode on one ViewController and e.g. update the text of a `UILabel` on another ViewController.

``` swift
extension ViewController: QRCodeCaptureDelegate {
    func didDecodeQRCode(withString string: String, byViewController vc: QRCodeCaptureViewController) {
        print("Successfully decoded QRCode: \(string)")
    }
}
```
